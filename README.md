# Full Stack Web Development Challenge

This comprehensive challenge involves creating and integrating various components to build a full-stack web application. The challenge consists of the following tasks

## Task 1: API with Express and Node.js
Create a simple REST API using Express. Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for a "User" resource. This task focuses on setting up a robust backend API to manage user data.

## Task 2: Web Server with Django and Python

Create a Django web server with a model, such as "Product." Implement CRUD operations for this model via Django's admin interface. This task is designed to showcase the capabilities of Django in handling data through an administrative interface.

## Task 3: API-to-Database Connection

Connect your Express API to a SQLite database using any ORM (Object-Relational Mapping). Implement the necessary configurations to store and retrieve "User" data. This task emphasizes the seamless interaction between the API and a relational database.

## Task 4: API Proxy with Python

Create a Python script that acts as a proxy. The script should forward requests from the Python script to the Express API. This task involves building a proxy to mediate communication between different components of the web application.

## Task 5: Integration

Make the Django web server fetch "User" data from the Express API via the Python proxy. This final task involves integrating the various components built in the previous tasks to demonstrate the flow of data from the Express API through a Python proxy to the Django web server
